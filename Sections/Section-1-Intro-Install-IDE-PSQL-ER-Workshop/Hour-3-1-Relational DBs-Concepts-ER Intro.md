## Entity-Relationship : The Basic Terms  in Relational DBs

### Entity

**Definition**: An entity can be a real-world object or concept that has a distinct and independent existence in a domain being modeled. 

**Characteristics**:
- It has attributes that represent properties of an entity.
- Each entity is uniquely identifiable.
- Examples: `Person`, `Car`, `Building`.

### Relationship

**Definition**: A relationship is a connection between two or more entities that interact in some way.

**Characteristics**:
- Relationships can have attributes.
- They are often named as verbs.
- Examples: A `Person` _owns_ a `Car`, a `Student` _attends_ a `Class`.

## Relational Algebra

### Basic Concepts

Relational algebra is a formal system for manipulating relations. Basic operations include:

- **Selection (σ)**: Selects rows from a relation that satisfy a given predicate.
- **Projection (π)**: Selects certain columns from a relation.
- **Union (⋃)**: Combines the results of two queries.
- **Set Difference (-)**: Finds tuples in one relation but not in another.
- **Cartesian Product (×)**: Combines tuples from two relations.

##### The Cartesian Product

The Cartesian Product, denoted by "×" in relational algebra, is an operation that returns all possible pairs of rows from two tables (relations). When you perform a Cartesian Product on two tables, the result is a new table that combines each row of the first table with each row of the second table.

Let's consider two simple example tables to illustrate the Cartesian Product:

**Table A (Students)**
| StudentID | Name  |
| --------- | ----- |
| 1         | Alice |
| 2         | Bob   |

**Table B (Courses)**
| CourseID | CourseName  |
| -------- | ----------- |
| C1       | Mathematics |
| C2       | Physics     |

### Cartesian Product of Tables A and B

The Cartesian Product A × B will produce:

| StudentID | Name  | CourseID | CourseName  |
| --------- | ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1         | Alice | C1       | Mathematics |
| 1         | Alice | C2       | Physics     |
| 2         | Bob   | C1       | Mathematics |
| 2         | Bob   | C2       | Physics     |

In this Cartesian Product, each student is paired with each course. So, with 2 students and 2 courses, we get 4 pairs in total.

### Characteristics of Cartesian Product

- The number of rows in the result is the product of the number of rows in the two tables. In our case, 2 students × 2 courses = 4 rows.
- The number of columns in the result is the sum of the number of columns in the two tables. In our case, 2 columns (from Students) + 2 columns (from Courses) = 4 columns.
- The Cartesian Product is rarely used in its raw form in practical SQL queries, as it often produces a large number of rows, many of which may not be meaningful. It's usually combined with a selection condition (a WHERE clause in SQL) to produce a more useful result, like joining tables on a common attribute.

### Practical Use in SQL (JOIN)

In SQL, a Cartesian Product is often the first step in performing a JOIN operation between two tables. For example, if you want to join these tables based on a common attribute, you would first perform the Cartesian Product and then apply a filter. However, in SQL, this is done more efficiently using JOIN clauses. 

For instance, if there was a common attribute linking students to courses (say a registration table), you would use a JOIN to match students with their specific courses, rather than listing all possible combinations.



### Relational Algebra Samples

1. **Selection**:
   ```sql
   σ(age > 30)(Employee)
   ```
   This selects employees older than 30.

2. **Projection**:
   ```sql
   π(name, salary)(Employee)
   ```
   This projects the `name` and `salary` columns from the `Employee` relation.

3. **Union**:
   ```sql
   (σ(department = 'Sales')(Employee)) ⋃ (σ(department = 'Marketing')(Employee))
   ```
   This combines employees from the Sales and Marketing departments.

## ORDBMS vs RDBMS

### Differences

| Feature            | ORDBMS (Object-Relational DBMS)                              | RDBMS (Relational DBMS)                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Model**     | Extends relational model with object-oriented features.      | Purely relational model.                                     |
| **Complexity**     | More complex, handles complex data types.                    | Simpler, primarily for structured data.                      |
| **Use Case**       | Suitable for applications requiring complex data representation (like CAD, multimedia). | Ideal for transactional and operational databases with structured data. |
| **Query Language** | Extensions to SQL for object-oriented features.              | Standard SQL.                                                |
| **Performance**    | Can be slower due to complexity.                             | Generally faster for simple queries.                         |
| **Example**        | PostgreSQL, Oracle.                                          | MySQL, SQLite.                                               |
