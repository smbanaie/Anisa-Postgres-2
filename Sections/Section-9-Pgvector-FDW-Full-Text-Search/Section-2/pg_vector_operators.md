#### PG Vector Operators

1. **Vector Operators Overview**

pg_vector provides several operators for working with vectors. These operators allow you to perform various operations like similarity searches, distance calculations, and vector arithmetic.

2. **Main Vector Operators**

a) Vector Addition (+)
b) Vector Subtraction (-)
c) L2 Distance (<->)
d) Inner Product (<#>)
e) Cosine Distance (<=>)

3. **Detailed Explanation of Vector Operators**

a) Vector Addition (+)
This operator adds two vectors element-wise.

Syntax: vector_a + vector_b

Example:
```sql
SELECT '[1,2,3]'::vector + '[4,5,6]'::vector;
-- Result: [5,7,9]
```

b) Vector Subtraction (-)
This operator subtracts one vector from another element-wise.

Syntax: vector_a - vector_b

Example:
```sql
SELECT '[4,5,6]'::vector - '[1,2,3]'::vector;
-- Result: [3,3,3]
```

c) L2 Distance (<->)
This operator calculates the Euclidean (L2) distance between two vectors.

Syntax: vector_a <-> vector_b

Example:
```sql
SELECT '[1,2,3]'::vector <-> '[4,5,6]'::vector;
-- Result: 5.196152422706632 (sqrt(3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2))
```

d) Inner Product (<#>)
This operator calculates the dot product (inner product) of two vectors.

Syntax: vector_a <#> vector_b

Example:
```sql
SELECT '[1,2,3]'::vector <#> '[4,5,6]'::vector;
-- Result: 32 (1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6)
```

e) Cosine Distance (<=>)
This operator calculates the cosine distance between two vectors.

Syntax: vector_a <=> vector_b

Example:
```sql
SELECT '[1,2,3]'::vector <=> '[4,5,6]'::vector;
-- Result: 0.025368153802923788
```

4. Practical Examples

Let's use these operators in the context of your product database:

```sql
-- Assuming we have a products table with pgvector_desc column

-- Find products with similar descriptions (using cosine similarity)
SELECT product_id, product_name, pgvector_desc <=> '[0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.3]'::vector AS cosine_distance
FROM products
ORDER BY cosine_distance
LIMIT 5;

-- Find products within a certain Euclidean distance
SELECT product_id, product_name, pgvector_desc <-> '[0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.3]'::vector AS euclidean_distance
FROM products
WHERE pgvector_desc <-> '[0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.3]'::vector < 1.0
ORDER BY euclidean_distance;

-- Compare two specific products
SELECT 
    p1.product_name AS product1,
    p2.product_name AS product2,
    p1.pgvector_desc <-> p2.pgvector_desc AS euclidean_distance,
    p1.pgvector_desc <=> p2.pgvector_desc AS cosine_distance,
    p1.pgvector_desc <#> p2.pgvector_desc AS inner_product
FROM 
    products p1,
    products p2
WHERE 
    p1.product_id = '1' AND p2.product_id = '2';
```

5. Advanced Usage: Vector Aggregation

pg_vector also provides aggregation functions for vectors:

a) vec_agg(): Aggregates vectors into an array of vectors
b) avg(): Calculates the average vector

Example:
```sql
-- Calculate the average vector for each category
SELECT 
    category,
    avg(pgvector_desc) AS avg_vector
FROM 
    products
GROUP BY 
    category;

-- Find products closest to their category average
WITH category_avgs AS (
    SELECT 
        category,
        avg(pgvector_desc) AS avg_vector
    FROM 
        products
    GROUP BY 
        category
)
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.category,
    p.pgvector_desc <-> ca.avg_vector AS distance_to_avg
FROM 
    products p
JOIN 
    category_avgs ca ON p.category = ca.category
ORDER BY 
    distance_to_avg
LIMIT 10;
```

6. Performance Optimization

When working with large datasets, you can create indexes to speed up vector operations:

```sql
-- Create an index for L2 distance
CREATE INDEX ON products USING ivfflat (pgvector_desc vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);

-- Create an index for cosine distance
CREATE INDEX ON products USING ivfflat (pgvector_desc vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100);

-- Create an index for inner product
CREATE INDEX ON products USING ivfflat (pgvector_desc vector_ip_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

These indexes use the IVFFlat algorithm, which is efficient for approximate nearest neighbor search.

7. Combining with Full-Text Search

You can combine vector similarity search with PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON products USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', seo_desc));

SELECT 
    product_id,
    product_name,
    seo_desc,
    pgvector_desc <=> '[0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.3]'::vector AS vector_similarity,
    ts_rank(to_tsvector('english', seo_desc), to_tsquery('english', 'sleep & disorder')) AS text_rank
FROM 
    products
WHERE 
    to_tsvector('english', seo_desc) @@ to_tsquery('english', 'sleep & disorder')
ORDER BY 
    vector_similarity + text_rank DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This query combines vector similarity with text relevance for more accurate results.

8. Updating Vectors

When you need to update vector data, you can use standard UPDATE statements:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET pgvector_desc = '[0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.3]'::vector
WHERE product_id = '1';
```

Remember to recalculate your vector data whenever the underlying text or features change.

This tutorial covers the main vector operators and their applications in pg_vector. These powerful tools allow you to perform complex similarity searches and vector operations directly in your PostgreSQL database, enabling advanced machine learning and recommendation system functionalities.
