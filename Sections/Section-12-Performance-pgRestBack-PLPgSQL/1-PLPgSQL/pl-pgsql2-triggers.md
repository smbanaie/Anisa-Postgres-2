**Introduction to Triggers**

Triggers are special types of database objects that automatically execute a function (or a set of SQL statements) in response to a specific event, such as an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation on a table. Triggers can be used to enforce data integrity, maintain consistency, and automate various data-related tasks.

**Step 1: Create a Trigger to Validate Job Listings**

Let's create a trigger that ensures the `location` field in the `job_listings` table is not left empty.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_job_listing()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.location IS NULL OR NEW.location = '' THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Job listing location cannot be empty.';
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER check_job_listing_location
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON job_listings
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION validate_job_listing();
```

Here's how the trigger works:

1. The `validate_job_listing()` function is a trigger function that checks if the `location` field in the `NEW` row (the row being inserted or updated) is `NULL` or an empty string.
2. If the location is empty, the function raises an exception with the message "Job listing location cannot be empty."
3. If the location is valid, the function returns the `NEW` row, allowing the operation to proceed.
4. The `check_job_listing_location` trigger is attached to the `job_listings` table and is executed before any `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operation on the table.

Now, let's test the trigger:

```sql
-- This should succeed
INSERT INTO job_listings (employer_id, title, description, location) 
VALUES (1, 'Software Engineer', 'Join our team', 'New York');

-- This should raise an exception
INSERT INTO job_listings (employer_id, title, description, location)
VALUES (2, 'Product Manager', 'Lead our projects', NULL);
```

The first `INSERT` statement should succeed, as it provides a valid location. The second `INSERT` statement should raise the exception defined in the `validate_job_listing()` function.

**Step 2: Create a Trigger to Track Job Application Status Changes**

Next, let's create a trigger that logs changes to the `status` field in the `applications` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE application_status_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    application_id INTEGER,
    old_status VARCHAR(20),
    new_status VARCHAR(20),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_application_status_change()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.status <> OLD.status THEN
        INSERT INTO application_status_log (application_id, old_status, new_status)
        VALUES (NEW.application_id, OLD.status, NEW.status);
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER track_application_status_changes
AFTER UPDATE OF status ON applications
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_application_status_change();
```

Here's how the trigger works:

1. We create a new table called `application_status_log` to store the changes to the `status` field in the `applications` table.
2. The `log_application_status_change()` function is the trigger function that compares the `status` field in the `NEW` row (the updated row) with the `OLD` row (the original row).
3. If the `status` has changed, the function inserts a new record into the `application_status_log` table, recording the `application_id`, the `old_status`, the `new_status`, and the `updated_at` timestamp.
4. The `track_application_status_changes` trigger is attached to the `applications` table and is executed after any `UPDATE` operation on the `status` field.

Let's test the trigger:

```sql
-- Update an application status
UPDATE applications 
SET status = 'accepted'
WHERE application_id = 1;

-- Check the application status log
SELECT * FROM application_status_log;
```

The update operation should trigger the `log_application_status_change()` function, and you should see a new record in the `application_status_log` table reflecting the status change.

**Step 3: Create a Trigger to Maintain User Email Uniqueness**

Finally, let's create a trigger to ensure that the `email` field in the `users` table is unique.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_unique_email()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE email = NEW.email AND user_id <> NEW.user_id) THEN
        RAISE UNIQUE_VIOLATION USING MESSAGE = 'Email already exists';
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER enforce_unique_email
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON users
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION check_unique_email();
```

Here's how the trigger works:

1. The `check_unique_email()` function is the trigger function that checks if the `email` field in the `NEW` row (the row being inserted or updated) already exists in the `users` table, excluding the current user's record.
2. If the email already exists, the function raises a `UNIQUE_VIOLATION` exception with the message "Email already exists."
3. If the email is unique, the function returns the `NEW` row, allowing the operation to proceed.
4. The `enforce_unique_email` trigger is attached to the `users` table and is executed before any `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operation on the table.

Let's test the trigger:

```sql
-- This should succeed
INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, email, user_type)
VALUES ('new_user', 'hashed_password', 'new@example.com', 'job_seeker');

-- This should raise an exception
INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, email, user_type)
VALUES ('duplicate_user', 'hashed_password', 'john@example.com', 'job_seeker');
```

The first `INSERT` statement should succeed, as it provides a unique email address. The second `INSERT` statement should raise the `UNIQUE_VIOLATION` exception, as the email address already exists in the `users` table.

**Conclusion**

In this tutorial, you've learned how to use triggers to:

1. Validate the data in the `job_listings` table, ensuring that the `location` field is not empty.
2. Track changes to the `status` field in the `applications` table by logging the changes in a separate table.
3. Enforce the uniqueness of the `email` field in the `users` table.

Triggers can be a powerful tool for maintaining data integrity, automating data-related tasks, and enforcing business rules in your database. As you continue to work with your PostgreSQL database, consider exploring more use cases for triggers to enhance the reliability and functionality of your applications.
